\title{
Outlier detection provided a distance/similarity matrix of sequences.
}
\description{
Provided a similarity matrix (like the ones provided using string kernels in \pkg{kebabs}). It will then compute a score for each sequence and perform bootstrap to provide information on the distribution of the scores, which is used to distinguish outlier sequences.
}
\usage{
odseq_unaligned(distance_matrix, B = 100, threshold = 0.025, type = "similarity")
}
\arguments{
  \item{distance_matrix}{
A numeric matrix representing either similarity or distance among unaligned sequences. Package \pkg{kebabs} may be useful for this task.
}

  \item{B}{
Integer indicating the number of bootstrap replicates to be run. The higher the more robust the detection should be.
}

  \item{threshold}{
Float indicating the probability to be left at the right of the bootstrap scores distribution when computing outliers. This parameter may need some tuning depending on each specific problem
}

  \item{type}{
A string indicating the type of distance metric used. Either \code{'similarity'} or \code{'distance'}.
}

  \item{weights}{
Numeric vector with the same length as the \code{msa_object}, giving weights for each sequence.  In particular, if these are integer values, then the result will be the same as if each row and column in the distance matrix was repeated a number of times equal to its weight, but will be calculated much more quickly.
}

\value{
Returns a logical vector, where \code{TRUE} indicates an outlier.
